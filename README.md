# React Testing Workshop

You will find 3 branches in this repository.

The [main](https://github.com/bignerdranch/react-testing-workshop) branch contains the backend.

The [starter](https://github.com/bignerdranch/react-testing-workshop/tree/starter) branch contains the React application without tests.

The [solution](https://github.com/bignerdranch/react-testing-workshop/tree/solution) branch contains the React application with tests.

To run the application locally or the Cypress tests, you will have to also be running the backend in another terminal tab (so you will need to download this repository twice).
