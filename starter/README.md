# React Testing Workshop

You will find 3 folders in this repository.

The `backend` directory contains the data needed to run the Coffee Shop.

The `starter` directory contains the React application without tests.

The `solution` directory contains the React application with tests.

To run the application locally or the Cypress tests, you will have to run the frontend and backend in two different terminal tabs.
